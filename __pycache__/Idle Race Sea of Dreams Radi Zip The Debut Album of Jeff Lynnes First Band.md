## The Idle Race: A Brief History
 
The Idle Race emerged from the ashes of The Nightriders, a Birmingham-based band that had been active since 1959 and had recorded several singles for EMI without much success. The Nightriders underwent several lineup changes, most notably the departure of Roy Wood, who left to form The Move in 1965, and the arrival of Jeff Lynne, a young and talented guitarist who had never been in a band before. Lynne soon became the main songwriter and singer of the group, which changed its name to The Idle Race in 1966.
 
The Idle Race signed with Liberty Records in 1967 and released their first single, \"The Skeleton and the Roundabout\", a catchy and whimsical psychedelic pop song that showcased Lynne's distinctive style and sense of humor. The song received airplay from influential DJ John Peel, who became a fan and supporter of the band. However, the single failed to chart, as did the follow-ups \"The End of the Road\" and \"I Like My Toys\". The band's debut album, The Birthday Party, was released in October 1968, and quickly earned praise for its witty and sparkling tunes and inventive arrangements and production, many taking advantage of the Mellotron keyboard.
 
The Idle Race continued to release singles and albums throughout 1969 and 1970, but none of them managed to break into the mainstream. The band also suffered from a lack of live exposure, as they were often overshadowed by more popular acts on the bill or had trouble finding gigs at all. Lynne also became frustrated with Liberty Records, which he felt did not promote the band properly or give them enough artistic freedom. In 1970, he decided to leave The Idle Race and join his old friend Roy Wood in The Move, with the intention of forming a new project called Electric Light Orchestra.
 
The remaining members of The Idle Race recruited two new guitarists, Dave Walker and Mike Hopkins, and switched to a more hard rock-oriented sound. They signed with Regal Zonophone Records and released their third and final album, Time Is, in 1971. The album was a departure from their previous work, featuring more progressive rock and folk rock influences. However, it did not sell well either, and the band soon disbanded. Some of the members went on to join other bands, such as The Steve Gibbons Band and Wizzard.
