Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali (Revised Edition) (Longman African Writers) is a book by Djibril Tamsir Niane, based on the oral tradition of the griots, the guardians of African culture. It tells the story of Sundiata, the founder of the Mali Empire in the 13th century. Sundiata was a legendary hero who overcame his physical disability, his exile, and his enemies to unite the twelve kingdoms of Mali into a powerful empire. The book is part history and part legend, and captures the mystery and majesty of medieval African kingship.
 
The book was first published in French in 1960 as Soundjata ou Epoque Mandiginue, and translated into English by G.D. Pickett in 1965. The revised edition was published by Longman in 2006, and includes background information, a who's who of characters, and a glossary of places. The book is part of the Longman African Writers/Classics Series, which aims to promote African literature to a wider audience.

The book begins with the prophecy of the birth of Sundiata, the son of NarÃ© Maghan, the king of Manding. NarÃ© Maghan is visited by a hunter who tells him that he will have a son by a woman with a buffalo's hump. The hunter also warns him that his son will be lame and will suffer many hardships, but he will become a great king and conqueror. NarÃ© Maghan follows the hunter's advice and marries Sogolon, a hunchbacked woman from the land of Do. Sogolon gives birth to Sundiata, who is indeed crippled and unable to walk.
 
Sundiata grows up under the care of his mother and his griot, Balla FassÃ©kÃ©, who teaches him the history and culture of his people. He also learns from his half-brother Manding Bory, who becomes his loyal friend and ally. Sundiata faces the hostility and jealousy of his stepmother Sassouma and her son Dankaran Touman, who inherit the throne after NarÃ© Maghan's death. Sassouma mistreats Sogolon and Sundiata, and tries to kill them several times. She also sends Sundiata away to the court of the king of Mema, where he learns to ride a horse and wield a sword.
 
Sundiata returns to Manding after hearing that his homeland is under attack by Soumaoro KantÃ©, the sorcerer king of Sosso, who has conquered most of West Africa. Soumaoro has also captured Balla FassÃ©kÃ© and taken him as his personal griot. Sundiata gathers an army of allies from various kingdoms, including his childhood friend Kamandjan from Kangaba, his uncle Mamoudou Tounkara from Wagadou, and his nephew Fakoli Koroma from Kaniaga. He also receives the support of Nana Triban, Soumaoro's sister and a powerful sorceress, who reveals to him Soumaoro's secrets and weaknesses.
